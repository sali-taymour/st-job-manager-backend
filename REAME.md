# ej2-job-manager

- **What we will build**
	- a useful, functional full-stack MERN site which allows you to collect, save and display information about job leads 
		- this is the beginning of a project which will become a site that managers your job seeking process
	- data will be saved in a database at your MongoDB Atlas database and will access your backend API at Heroku
	- frontend will be at Netlify and will access your API at Heroku
	- in this version, this site will be read-only
	- you will have one local directory for the project called **st-job-manager-project** where `st` are your initials (don't use `st` since those are my initials)
		- inside this folder you will have two projects:
			- **st-job-manager-backend**
				- this will also be the name of your
					- backend repository at GitHub
					- your app at Heroku
				- Heroku app names must be 30 characters or less 
				- the URL to your backend API will be: `https://st-job-manager-backend.herokuapp.com/`
			- **st-job-manager**
				- this will be the name of your
					- frontend repository at GitHub
					- your app at Netlify
				- your Netlify URL will be called http://st-job-manager.netlify.app
					- it doesn't have the word `frontend` in it since will be an outward-facing URL that you will give to other people  in order for them to log into your site
- **What we will use:**
	- Node/Express and MongoDB Atlas will be used for the backend
	- React (Vite) will be used for the frontend
